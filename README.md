#ESP HVAC

##Introduction
*This code aims to control a Panassonic HVAC over the internet. This project has been achieved with the help of Vincent Cruvellier (https://github.com/r45635) and this code is based on the version he built for his Mitsubishi HVAC.
*This code was initially developed to work with classical Arduino board and has been then ported to an ESP based board.
*Note the the reverse engineering of the HVAC protocol has been managed using AnalySIR software.
